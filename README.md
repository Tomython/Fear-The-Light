# Fear-The-Light
The official repository of the indie game Fear The light

This is an email to those who have logged into this repository and are wondering why it is empty. Answer: "Because for some reason Git doesn't want to upload the game here. The second reason is that the game is not finished, and the Alpha version is currently being developed, and what is currently on itch.io this is a prototype. And if I put an incomplete alpha version here, and even more so in open access, it will be unpleasant for me."

And this is a letter to the judges from Game of 2024: "I offer my deepest apologies =( "
